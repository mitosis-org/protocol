This project is using Solidity to writing smart contracts.
And also, Using Foundry to test / build / deploy thoses contracts.
Besides of that, We're using Soldeer + Yarn as package manager. Thanks for Foundry integration, We're using Soldeer with `forge soldeer` command.

For the other things, This project is using Typescript for tooling like sorting imports or publish interfaces to the public, etc...
