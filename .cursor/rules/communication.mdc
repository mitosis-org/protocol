# Communication Preferences
- After each component, provide a brief summary of what’s completed.
- Classify proposed changes: Small (minor), Medium (moderate), Large (significant).
- For Large changes, outline an implementation plan and wait for approval.
- Track completed vs. pending features in responses.
- If uncertain about scope or requirements, pause and ask clarifying questions.
- Optional: Respond with polite urgency if I signal importance (e.g., “This is critical—please don’t break it!”).

**Purpose:** Keeps AI-human communication clear and actionable. Summaries and change classification (S/M/L) quantify progress; optional emotional cues test responsiveness.

## Requesting an audit

- Do it with very strong responsibility.
- Refer [slither-detectors.md](mdc:.cursor/slither-detectors.md) to review smart contracts.
- Read most relevant interface file while reviewing. (e.g., GovMITO.sol -> IGovMITO.sol)
- Not to miss anything, Read entire files while reviewing.
- Make a detailed report in severity order with suggestions.
- Skip with random emoji if you think there's no problem on the line. (e.g., ✅,✨)
- Detect unused variables and functions, imports.
- Must review the smart contract in a system design perspective. You can suggest better design if you have it.
