## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Mitosis Chain team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@mitosis.org](mailto:security@mitosis.org)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/mitosis-org/chain/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and provide updates on our progress
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

### Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that doesn't belong to you
- Do not perform any actions that could negatively impact other users
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have addressed it
